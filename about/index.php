<h2>Who is Andrew Pong?</h2>
<p>I am the webmaster of this website. Physically, I am a 18 year old student attending Diablo Valley College in the San Francisco Bay Area. Unfortunetly for my dying video gaming life, I now spend most of my time learning and expanding my knowledge in web programming, particularily PHP and MySQL. Prior to being bitten by the PHP/MySQL bug, I was an avid player of games like Counter-Strike Source, Neverwinter Nights, Diablo 2, and Age of Empires 3. I still play them on occasion.</p>
<p>This website is designed to be a playground of sorts for my PHP exercises. I do have a offline server for myself, but I figured that it would be more fun to have other people try to hack my site as I work on it.</p>
<p>I have been on the internet regularily since mid 1999, and only started my own website since early 2006. I have been studying webdesign, accessibility guidelines, PHP, MySQL, and proper coding practices full time since then. I always regret I did not jump on the GeoCities bandwagon... too bad. Unfortunately for my eyes, some of those mid-1990s webpages are still alive and kicking. Geez... some things should just die.</p>
